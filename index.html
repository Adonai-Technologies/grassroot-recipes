             <p2>If ever there was a perfect use for leftover white rice, Chinese Fried Rice is it! We love it so much that when I cook rice for a dish, I almost always double or triple the amount to ensure enough for fried rice the next night. In this case, we’re sharing our Beef Fried Rice recipe, which is my family’s favorite version. Filled with sirloin, vegetables, egg, and a deep, rich sauce, it’s such a fantastic all-in-one meal</p2>
